# Pyproxy

A Python implementation of a MTG (or any card game, with a bit of tinkering) Proxy PDF creator.

## Installation

`git clone` this repository, and run with `python3 main.py`. It defaults to running with conf.json, but you can change the configuration by running `python3 main.py conf2.json`, or whatever your configuration file is called.

## Images Used
